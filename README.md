Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was the banking project in which we had to create a program that was able to show interest on a yearly basis with monthly depositis and less monthly deposits 


What did you do particularly well?
I think I made it super readable, ensuring white spaces were in there properly as well as modularizing it. 


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think I would want to try and expand logic with seeing the interest monthly or adding more funcationality. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the logic behind the math confusing just slightly but when I came down to it I tried to use algerbra and translate that into code. When in doubt I will be looking to algebra to get logic for code. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The modulaization made it super easy and Im goign to transfer that to different projects from now on.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it maintainable by breaking it down in smaller chunks to make it more readable and maintainable.
